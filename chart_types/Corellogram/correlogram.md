# Correlogram

# Alternative names: 
- correlation matrix, correlation graph

# Functions & Purpose:
- Helping in understanding the correlation between multiple variables in a dataset by showing the correlation coefficients between pairs of variables in a dataset.
- Purpose is to identify patterns, trends and or relationships among variables.
- Useful in exploratory data analysis to check for potential relationships or redundancies.

# Aesthetics used:
- Colors
- Position
- Sizes

# Potential pitfalls:
- Too many variables can make the correlogram cluttered and difficult to interpret.
- If the color scale lacks contrast or is not intuitive it may lead to misinterpretations.
- Assuming that correlation implies causation. This mistake occurs when concluding that one variable causes another simply because they are correlated.
